## The Idea
There is a shortage of blood worldwide on normal days itself and during this pandemic the shortage is even worse. My idea is to design a platform that allows donors to connect with Blood Banks and Hospitals which are in need of blood and allows Organizations dealing with blood to easily contact each other. Organizations can make their requirements public as to how much blood they need of which group and what type of blood they have in stock. Donors can contact there organizations and volunteer to donate the blood. Other organizations with a surplus of particular blood type can also help out each other. NGOs and Blood Banks hosting Blood Donation Camps can also make them public with the location so interested donors can donate easily.
